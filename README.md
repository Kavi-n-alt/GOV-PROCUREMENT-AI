# Unified Government Tender Intelligence System

## Problem
Government tenders in India are published across multiple portals in PDF and web
formats with inconsistent structures, making analysis and transparency difficult.

## Solution
This project builds an open-source pipeline to extract tender data from government
documents, normalize it into a unified schema, and prepare AI-ready datasets.

## Current Features
- PDF-based tender text extraction (CPPP)
- Basic field identification
- Unified tender schema

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pdfplumber
- pandas

## Future Work
- Deduplication across portals
- Dashboard for tender analytics
- Support for GeM and Railways
